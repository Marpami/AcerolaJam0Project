This project is for the game jam Acerola Jam 0

The game was made in 2 weeks for the Game Jam.
I worked for 11 days and each day I spent about 4-6 hours working on the project.
The first day was spent planning.
About 4 days I spent programming and the rest of the time was spent on making the art, music, sound effects, and setting up the website.
So none of the assets are downloaded but made by me.
